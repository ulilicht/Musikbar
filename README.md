## Installation

2. Open the disk image and drag **Musikbar** to your **Applications** folder.
3. Launch the app.

### ⚠️ Security Notice (Unsigned App)

The app is not code-signed, as I don't own an Apple Developer Certificate. There are two shortcomings:

- On first launch, the app needs to be launched from Mac system settings / security.
- On every start, the app will ask to accept incoming network connections

You can overcome both by compiling the app from source yourself using your own developer certificate (see [Development](#development)).

## Development

### Basics

The app is created using React, Electron and connects to [Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/).

To get started, read about the concepts in

- https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
- https://www.electronforge.io/
- https://music-assistant.io/

### Preparation

The App needs apple codesigning to run, as it opens a Network server. If you don't add a certificate, the app will still
run but ask for permissions to access the network on each launch.

1. Create a certificate
2. Create a copy of `./codesign.config.dist.js` as `./codesign.config.js`
3. Add your certificate details to the new file.

More information can be found in the [Electron Docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/code-signing)

### Prerequisites

- You need to use Node version 18. (Dependency of electron-forge)
- If you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed, run `nvm use 18` before running any commands.

### Starting

- run `npm start`
- run `npm run start-electron` in another Terminal window.

### Building

- run `npm run make`
