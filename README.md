2. Open the disk image and drag **Musikbar** to your **Applications** folder.
3. Launch the app.

### ⚠️ Security Notice (Unsigned App)

The app is not code-signed, as I don't own an Apple Developer Certificate. There are two shortcomings:

- On first launch, the app needs to be launched from Mac system settings / security.
- On every start, the app will ask to accept incoming network connections

You can overcome both by compiling the app from source yourself using your own developer certificate (see [Development](#development)).

## Development

### Basics

The app is created using React, Tauri and connects to [Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/).

To get started, read about the concepts in

- https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
- https://v2.tauri.app
- https://music-assistant.io/

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** - Required for building Tauri
  - Install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)

### Starting Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the app in development mode
npm start
```

This will launch both the React dev server and the Tauri application.

### Building for Release

Upgrade the version:

```bash
npx bumpp
```

```bash
npm run make
```

The built application will be available in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Code Signing (Optional)

To sign the app with your own Apple Developer certificate, configure Tauri's signing options in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. See the [Tauri Code Signing docs](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/macos/) for more information.
